## Synopsis

There are many breakfast places around Fort Collins, CO - some great and some awful and many in between. This is a basic webapp that provides the service of voting on various aspects of each breakfast place and stores them in a database for future comprison. 

## OMG It's Magic!!

No it's not. Don't be fooled by the django back-end. It has a simple look to it but it gets the job done and was quite the learning experience of Heather.
